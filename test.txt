DANCE ALONE - ZIOR PARK
I wanna switch off my head for a while
You're always saying too much, can't you just dial it down?
I wanna shut down my P-O-V for a while
Your shadow lingers too close, I can't take it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me sink in my quiet melancholy
Sometimes it's fine to lean into the lonely
Perfect light, perfect stage
Oh, please, turn on the lights for me
I'll be dancing alone

[Chorus]
Dance, feel alive, I would dive into the dark
I love to be alone
So leave me alone
Dance, feel the vibe, I might be a narcissist
I love to be alone
Just leave me alone

[Post-Chorus]
Dance alone
I'm dancing alone
Dance alone
Don't ring the alarm
Dance alone
I'm dancing alone
Dance alone
Don't ring the alarm

[Verse 2]
Somebody to love, uh
Somebody to hurt, uh
I'm exhausted by all of them, uh-huh
Where should I go
Well, don't give a, uh
Lately, I don't overthink for myself

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm growing up
But why can't I get used to this
Like adolescence
It's getting tough
So I gave up on this early
Just leave me alone

[Chorus]
Dance, feel alive, I would dive into the dark
I love to be alone
So leave me alone
Dance, feel the vibe, I might be a narcissist
I love to be alone
Just leave me alone

[Post-Chorus]
Dance alone
I'm dancing alone
Dance alone
Don't ring the alarm
Dance alone
I'm dancing alone
Dance alone
Dance alone
[Bridge]
See me dancing
So how do you feel about my dancing now?
See me dancing
Soon, you're gonna recognize yourself from mine

[Chorus]
Dance, feel alive, I would dive into the dark
I love to be alone
So leave me alone
Dance, feel the vibe, I might be a narcissist
I love to be alone
Just leave me alone

[Post-Chorus]
Dance alone
I'm dancing alone
Dance alone
Don't ring the alarm
Dance alone
I'm dancing alone
Dance alone
Dance alone
