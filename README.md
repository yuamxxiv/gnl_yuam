## Resources

Throughout this project, I utilized various learning resources to deepen my understanding:

- **Peer Learning**: Collaborating with fellow students and participating in peer evaluations helped me grasp difficult concepts through clear explanations and different perspectives.

- **Online Resources**: I supplemented my learning with YouTube tutorials and educational videos that provided visual explanations of complex topics.

- **AI Assistance**: I used AI tools as a learning companion, allowing me to ask questions repeatedly without hesitation until I fully understood challenging concepts. This provided a judgment-free environment to explore topics at my own pace.

These diverse resources complemented each other, helping me to finish the project.
